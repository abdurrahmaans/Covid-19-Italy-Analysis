# Covid-19-Italy-Analysis
Analysis of data based on regions for Italy, Comparison between regions of Italy. How the cases increased with date. The relationship of them with testing rates

code_italy.py - Has code for loading the dataset and grouping them according to date and also finding the per rate increase in cases

covid_total_test.py - Code for loading dataset with testing data according to date and also accrding to region grouping

merge_data.py - Merging data from above two files and then removing unwanted and unmatching data. Grouping done by date and also by region wise breakdown

visualization.py - using matlabplot and seaborn we are visualising data the relationship between the dates and increase in cases and also relationship between the testing and new cases

visualization_region.py - using matlabplot and seaborn to do the same as done in previous file but on region basis.

The Analysis shows the increase in cases with days and also how it is varying with each regions. 
The most important factor is relationship between testing rates and actual cases where we can see clear corellation that only with increased number of testing rapid increase on cases is seen .

The point we are trying to prove here is as many countries are not involved in high count of testing needs to quicken their increasing testing rates to find out the more number of cases involved as we see in italy.
